<h1>
        Project Proposal
</h1>
<h2>
        Ale's Cooking Blog
</h2>
<p>
      The objective of this blog is to show home made cooking recipes I do. I would divide by types of cuisine: Latin cuisine, Italian desserts and healthy.

</p>
<p>
    My target audience is everyone who want ot learn easy and delicious cooking recipes. 
</p>
    <p>
        There is going to be 4 pages you can go to from the main page of my website. The main page will describe the types of cuisine and a little background history of each type of cuisine. Each page will be dedicated to the types of cuisine previously mentioned.It would include at least two recipes per type of cuisine. Each recipe would include the ingredients and the preparation process. It is important to include pictures in order to attract people to do the recipe.
